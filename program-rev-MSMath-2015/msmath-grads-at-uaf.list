At some point it dawned on me to make a list of DMS Masters graduates who *currently work at UAF* (that I can think of):

Ron Barry (MS Math): Prof DMS
Odile Bastille (MS Math): Adjunct Instructor DMS
Latrice Bowman (MS Math): Instructor DMS
Tim Carlson (MS Math): Asst Prof, Bristol Bay Campus
Sarah Garland (MS Math, I think): Program Director Osher LLI
Constantine Khroulev (MS Math): Research Professional GI
Julie McIntyre (MS Stat): Assoc Prof DMS
Dmitry Nikolsky (MS Math): Research Asst Prof GI
Tony Rickard (MAT Math, I think): Prof DMS
Kat Sorenson (MS Math): Instructor DMS
Dana Thomas (MS Stat): Vice Chancellor of whatever
YuanYaun Zhao (MS Math): Adjunct Instructor DMS
Beth Zirbes (MS Math): Adjunct Instructor DMS

I bet I have missed several.  Also there are recent grads who have/had some position at UAF but may not be full employees right now: Amy Barnsley, Elchin Jafarov, Slava Garayshin, Jake Stroh come to mind.

Of course for some of these grads it is the terminal credential, and for some just a step.

One could say: Does UAF think this program is unimportant, given so many are hired?

In any case, if there is a threat of MS cancellation I would propose that we might recruit these people to walk into Susan's office or something.

The one PhD graduate that I think is UAF-employed is Anna Bulanova, but I cannot find her by searching; for sure she *was* UAF employed.
